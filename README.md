# ðŸ§¾ Invoice Dashboard

A responsive, modular invoice dashboard built with **React + TypeScript**.
It supports filtering by invoice status and sorting by amount or date â€” with performance optimized using `useMemo`.

---

## Features

* **Filter** invoices by status (`All`, `Paid`, `Pending`, `Overdue`)
* **Sort** invoices by `Date` or `Amount`
* **Revenue Summary** (Total & Filtered Paid Revenue)
* **useMemo Optimization** to avoid unnecessary recalculations
* **Fully responsive** layout with TailwindCSS
* Modular component and utility structure

## ðŸ§  useMemo in Action

This project uses `useMemo` to **memoize expensive computations** such as filtering, sorting, and calculating totals. This ensures smooth performance even with large datasets.

| Hook               | Purpose                            | Recomputes When...                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `filteredInvoices` | Filter invoice list by status      | `invoices` or `statusFilter` changes      |
| `sortedInvoices`   | Sort filtered list by date/amount  | `filteredInvoices` or `sortField` changes |
| `totalRevenue`     | Compute total revenue from Paid    | `invoices` changes                        |
| `filteredRevenue`  | Compute revenue from filtered list | `sortedInvoices` changes                  |
| `statusCounts`     | Count invoices per status type     | `invoices` changes                        |
